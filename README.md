# Controlling_rising_churn_in_telecom
A project on rising churn rates in telecom sector and ways to control it.

The problem statement is that We have to find out the factors which are driving the churn (either up or down) and then decrease the positive drivers while increasing the negative drivers so that the net effect on the churn is as small (or negative) as possible.

Analyzing the business context i.e. since it is a binomial event where we have to predict the possibility of high churn or not, we would therefore build our model be using Logistics Regression technique.

A high level data report is created in Excel with help of R which details the description of the attributes and also details the quantile break up of attributes so that it becomes easy for us to understand the variables, and also find out the missing variables and provide information about outliers.

The bivariate analysis of the attributes (Profiling) is performed in Excel and this input is used to perform the other steps for data exploration and data preparation is performed in R.

The data report and profiling of excel files are not attached here. If neeeded, please drop a request on my below mentioned website and i will try to do the needful.

The final data preparation steps as in treatment of missing values, variables reduction, dummy variables creation, treatment of outliers, creating derived variables and sampling are all listed in the R file.

The model building along with several iteration, the final model validation and the scoring of model is all shown in R file as part of final steps.
